# Case B — Talk Track 

1) The biggest robotaxi UX gaps often aren’t in driving, but in PUDO: long waits, constrained points, and last-50m uncertainty.  
2) My MVP upgrades “one point” into “Fast vs Closest choice + incident-aware blacklisting + requested→actual offset clustering.”  
3) I track time-to-pickup p95, cancellation buckets, and dwell p95, validated via scenario regression and limited pilots.


pain (long tail) → dual-mode pickup → incident sensing → clustering flywheel → metrics → V&V/release gates → risks.
