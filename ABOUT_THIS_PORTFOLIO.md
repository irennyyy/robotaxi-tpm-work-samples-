# About this portfolio

## Purpose
This is not a "fake real project". It's a demonstration of structured thinking with limited information:
assumption → scope → metrics → validation → rollout/ops.

## Principles
Public sources + explicit assumptions only.
Placeholder thresholds/values to illustrate measurement and release gates.
Avoid deep algorithm claims; focus on TPM deliverables and operability.

## How to use
- Start with EXEC_SUMMARY + TALK_TRACK;
- Use PRD/METRICS/V&V for deeper discussion.
- Deep dive: Case B research notes show my thinking about data flywheels and risks.
